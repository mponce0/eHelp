Version: 1.2.1
Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Marcelo",
           family = "Ponce",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "m.ponce@utoronto.ca")
Author: Marcelo Ponce [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Marcelo Ponce <m.ponce@utoronto.ca>
Description: By overloading the R help() function, this package allows users to use "docstring" style comments within their own defined functions. The package also provides additional functions to mimic the R basic example() function and the prototyping of packages.
